## Day 11: 
- Part1: Count numbers that have a certain criteria. The list becomes very big very quick.
- Part2: Much longer list. Python's `Counter` makes short work of this.

## Day 10: 
- Part1: Find number of trails from a starting point: shortest path.
- Part2: Find number of trails from a starting point: all paths that go from 0 - 9 in a trail. Difference between part1 and part2 is essentially a `set()` replaced with a `list()`

## Day 09:
- Part1: Disk defragmenting single digits
- Part2: Disk defragmenting complete files. This one took me quite some time to get the pointers correct.

## Day 08
- Part 1: Tower locations along an axis in a grid.
- Part 2: Same, but slightly more complicated.

## Day 07
- Part 1: Find the correct operators: "*" and "+" to get to a solution.
- Part 2: Find the correct operators: "*", "+" and "||". This solution is very slow, but it works. (takes about 3')

## Day 06
- Part 1: Traverse grid and count steps of guard.
- Part 2: Introduce loops the security guard will take

## Day 05
- Part 1: Check if sorted
- Part 2: Sort according to rules

## Day 04:
- Part 1: Find "XMAS" string in matrix
```text
..X..
.XMAS
..XSX
```
- Part 2: Find a 'cross':

```text
M.S
.A.
M.S
```

## Day 03:
- Part 1: Regex find and do `mul(x, y)` 
- Part 2: Same but with added `do()` and `don't()` to do an instruction.

## Day 02
- Part 1: Comparing increasing/decreasing lists
- Part 2: Same, but up to one item removed.

## Day 01
- Part 1: Sorting and comparing numbers
- Part 2: Finding occurences and multiply
