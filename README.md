# AoC2024

## Day 14: ⭐⭐ 
- [x] Part 1: Position of robots at time step 100
- [x] Part 2: Which time shows a christmas tree?
  - I went for reddit for this one. Approach was to find the second where the safety factor is smallest.

## Day 13: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Systems of equations. Solved with sympy library.
- [x] Part 2: Same, but with bigger numbers.

## Day 12: ⭐
- [x] Part 1: Find area and perimeter of fences. (BFS)
- [ ] Part 2: Find length of sides of perimeter (still stuck with this one)

## Day 11: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Count numbers that have a certain criteria. The list becomes very big very quick.
- [x] Part 2: Much longer list. Python's `Counter` makes short work of this.

## Day 10: ⭐⭐ 
- [x] Part 1: Find number of trails from a starting point: shortest path.
- [x] Part 2: Find number of trails from a starting point: all paths that go from 0 - 9 in a trail. Difference between part1 and part2 is essentially a `set()` replaced with a `list()`

## Day 09: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Disk defragmenting single digits
- [x] Part 2: Disk defragmenting complete files. This one took me quite some time to get the pointers correct. 
    - [ ] I borked the commits of Part2. Fix later.

## Day 08: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Tower locations along an axis in a grid.
- [x] Part 2: Same, but slightly more complicated.

## Day 07: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Find the correct operators: "*" and "+" to get to a solution.
- [x] Part 2: Find the correct operators: "*", "+" and "||". This solution is very slow, but it works. (takes about 3')

## Day 06: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Traverse grid and count steps of guard.
- [x] Part 2: Introduce loops the security guard will take

## Day 05: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Check if sorted
- [x] Part 2: Sort according to rules

## Day 04: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Find "XMAS" string in matrix
```text
..X..
.XMAS
..XSX
```
- [x] Part 2: Find a 'cross':

```text
M.S
.A.
M.S
```

## Day 03: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Regex find and do `mul(x, y)` 
- [x] Part 2: Same but with added `do()` and `don't()` to do an instruction.

## Day 02: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Comparing increasing/decreasing lists
- [x] Part 2: Same, but up to one item removed.

## Day 01: ⭐⭐
- [x] Part 1: Sorting and comparing numbers
- [x] Part 2: Finding occurences and multiply
